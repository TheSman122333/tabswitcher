Sneaky boy... 

I know what you are looking for.

This repo is designed to automatically open a website tab when 2 faces are detected within 1 frame.

Basically, when a parent or an unwanter visitor enters, it opens google classroom. To reset it, you need to look away or down or something to reset the facecount. Then if another unwanted visitor enters, the script will execute again.
